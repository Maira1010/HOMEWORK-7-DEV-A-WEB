    <h1>WELCOME!</h1>
    <h4>This is a website where you can find all different animals and their descriptions</h4>
    <div class="modelCardBox">
    <p class="modelCard">Purpose: This website will teach you about different animals and their features and descriptions so you can have all details about them and get to know nature!</p>
    <p class="modelCard">Limitations: There will not be all animals listed but only some. Not everything about them will be there but their common features and adaptations so you might not get much deep or specific research!</p>
    <p class="modelCard">Data: data will be taken from google and wikipedia and using FetchApi to fetch the data in code. Api is taken from: API Ninjas https://api-ninjas.com</p>

    <b><u>NOTE: The fetch api command is successfully working and the api's data is fetched but no matter how hard we try, we are not able to display the data! sorry for the disappointment...</u></b>
